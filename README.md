# WeatherApp
A Weather App that displays some useful information.

I managed to successfully:
1) make a mediocre layout in basic Bootstrap
2) create a search button that takes in the city input
3) store and display the search info
4) display current weather conditions

I attempted but ultimately failed to:
1) display UV index
2) time
3) 5 day forecast
4) display in sidebar

perhaps i got a few elements of starting down those paths correct. i learned a ton, but my pace was too slow and ran out of time.
